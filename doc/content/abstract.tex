This paper presents the specialization project by Manuele Nolli, student of the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Switzerland with a focus on Computer Science. The project, in collaboration with the Institute of Information Systems and Networking (ISIN) at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), aims to analyse the current state of Blockchain technology, specifically in the areas of Account Abstraction and Cross-Chain Communication. The core of the project is the development of a decentralized wallet, named Sapphire Wallet, which allows users to interact seamlessly with multiple blockchains without requiring technical knowledge.

The results demonstrate that Sapphire Wallet significantly improves user interface and experience compared to traditional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, offering intuitive transaction processes and enhanced account recoverability through trusted third parties (Guardians). However, the implementation faces challenges such as slow transaction speeds and high deployment costs, rendering it impractical for global adoption in its current form.

Despite these limitations, the Sapphire Wallet showcases the potential of the Account Abstraction paradigm and highlights the necessity for protocol updates to fully implement its capabilities. The paper also suggests that new blockchain systems, like ICP, which incorporate Account Abstraction and advanced Cross-Chain Communication paradigms, should be closely observed as they might represent the future of Blockchain technology.
