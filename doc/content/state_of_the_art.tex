\label{chap:state_of_the_art}

This chapter presents the state of the art of Blockchain interoperability and account abstraction, with an emphasis on EVM-compatible Blockchains.\cite{evm} 

In the first section, the concept of Account Abstraction is introduced, with a focus on the evolution of the proposals, followed by an analysis of the Argent wallet, to understand how Account Abstraction can improve the user experience.

The second section presents the state of the art of Cross-Chain Communication, categorising the bridges according to the trust model, communication model, and asset transfer model. 

Finally, the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is presented, as it is a promising Blockchain solution for both Account Abstraction and Cross-Chain Communication.
