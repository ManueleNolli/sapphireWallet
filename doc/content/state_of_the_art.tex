\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chap:state_of_the_art}

This chapter presents the state of the art of blockchain interoperability and account abstraction, with an emphasis on EVM-compatible blockchains.\cite{evm} In the first section, the concept of account abstraction is introduced, with a focus on the evolution of the ERC standards and the Argent wallet. The second section presents the state of the art of cross-chain communication, categorising the bridges according to the trust model, communication model, and asset transfer model. Finally, the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is presented, as it is a promising solution for both account abstraction and cross-chain communication.
