This paper presents the first specialization project by Manuele Nolli, a \textit{Master of Science in Engineering}\footnote{https://www.msengineering.ch/} (MSE) student specializing in Computer Science in Switzerland. The MSE program is offered collaboratively by eight Universities of Applied Sciences in Switzerland, with this particular project carried out in partnership with the \textit{Institute of Information Systems and Networking}\footnote{https://www.supsi.ch/isin} (ISIN) at the\textit{University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland}\footnote{https://www.supsi.ch/} (SUPSI).

The primary goal of this project is to analyse the current state of the art of Blockchain technology, focusing specifically on \textit{Account Abstraction} and \textit{Cross-Chain Communication}. The project aims to develop a decentralized wallet that allows users to interact with multiple Blockchains in a seamless way. The wallet is designed to make Blockchain technology more accessible and intuitive, addressing a significant barrier to broader adoption.
