% Starting point to undesrtand the potential of the blockchain tecnology with AA
The Sapphire Wallet provides insight into what the future of blockchain technology could be. Indeed, it permits the interaction with multiple Blockchains in combination of a user experience never seen before. The \textit{Account Abstraction} paradigm is not a new concept in Ethereum, but the complexity of the implementation is high. In fact, until now, none of the proposals have been fully accepted by the Ethereum community. 
%ADD SOMETHING

The Sapphire Wallet is a proof of concept that shows the potential of the \textit{Account Abstraction} paradigm, but it is not feasible in the long run. The separation of the transaction system is not a viable solution, as it is too complex and expensive. The implementation of the \textit{Account Abstraction} paradigm requires a protocol update.

% New blockchain tecnology with different paradigms and with AA built it must be watched with attention like ICP

In the other hand, new Blockchain systems like \hyperref[sec:icp]{ICP} have \textit{Account Abstraction} and new \textit{Cross-chain communication} paradigms built-in. They must be watched with attention, as they could be the future of the Blockchain technology.
