Blockchain technology lacks of \textit{user experience}, every time a user wants to interact with a Blockchain, he needs to sign a transaction, pay a fee, and wait for the transaction to be confirmed. This is a big barrier for the adoption of Blockchain technology, compared to the traditional web 2.0 applications where the interaction is seamless, and the user does not need to know anything about the underlying technology. 

The field is a very active research area, many solutions and chains have been proposed. In fact, millions of users and developers started to use them. \cite{blockchain-statistics} However, an important question arises when there are multiple chains: \textit{which one should I use?}

Interoperability is the answer to this question, as it allows different chains to communicate with each other. In this way, the decision of which chain to use is not relevant and a business can benefit from the best features of each chain without losing market share. But how can this be achieved \textit{without experienced users?}

The goal of this Master project is to analyse the current state of the art of Blockchain \textit{Interoperability} and \textit{Account Abstraction}, and to propose a solution that allows users to interact with multiple chains without the need to have any kind of knowledge about the used technology.
