Blockchain technology presents significant barriers to mainstream adoption due to its complex \textit{user experience}. Interacting with a Blockchain typically requires users to navigate through technical processes such as signing transactions, paying fees, and waiting for confirmations. This complexity contrasts with the seamless user experience of traditional web 2.0 applications, where users can interact without any knowledge of the underlying technology.

The field is a very active research area, many solutions and chains have been proposed. In fact, millions of users and developers started to use them. \cite{blockchain-statistics} However, an important question arises when there are multiple chains: \textit{which one should I use?}

Interoperability is the answer to this question, enabling different blockchain networks to communicate effectively with each other. By achieving interoperability, the decision of which chain to use is not relevant and a business can benefit from the best features of each chain without losing market share. But how can this be achieved \textit{without experienced users?}

The objective of this Master's project is to analyse the current state of the art of Blockchain \textit{Interoperability} and \textit{Account Abstraction}, and to propose a solution that allows users to interact with multiple Blockchains eliminating the need for technical knowledge.
