\section{Blockchain}
\label{sec:blockchain}

Various smart contracts are implemented  and deployed on the blockchain to manage the Sapphire Wallet. There is a distinction between the Base Chain and the Dest Chain(s):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Base Chain}: smart contracts to manage Account Creation, Wallet Recovery, Transaction execution, etc.
    \item \textit{Dest Chain(s)}: smart contracts to abstract the \textit{Base Chain} accounts and securely implement the bridge between the \textit{Base Chain} and the \textit{Dest Chain(s)}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Base Chain}
\label{subsec:base_chain}

The Base Chain is the main blockchain where the Sapphire Wallet is deployed. The contracts are an extension of the \hyperref[subsec:argent]{Argent Wallet} contracts.
