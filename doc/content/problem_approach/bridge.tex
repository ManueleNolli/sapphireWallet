\section{Bridge}
\label{sec:bridge}

The bridge is a key component of the Sapphire Wallet. It allows the user to interact with different blockchains. The bridge main purpose is to listen to the events emitted by the \textit{InteroperabilityManager} contract on the \textit{Base Chain} and relay them to the related \textit{Dest Chain} \textit{SapphireWrappedAccounts} contracts. 

More in detail, the bridge is a \textit{trusted Bridge} written in Typescript that uses the \textit{Lock \& Mint} asset transfer model. 

The Sapphire Bridge does not transfer only assets as the native tokens or NFTs, but also \textbf{general transactions}. Indeed, with the \hyperref[sec:blockchain]{Sapphire Account Abstraction infrastructure}, the \hyperref[sec:mobile_application]{Mobile Application} and the Bridge, the user has the impression that he is interacting with a single Blockchain, while in reality, he is interacting with multiple Blockchains.
