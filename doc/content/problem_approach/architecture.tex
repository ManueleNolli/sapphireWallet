\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

The Sapphire Wallet ecosystem is composed of four components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Blockchain}: Two or more Blockchains networks of which one is called \textit{Base Chain} and the others are called \textit{Dest Chain(s)}. The Acccount Abstraction Layer is implemented on the \textit{Base Chain}.
    \item \textit{Bridge}: \textit{Lock \& Mint} bridge that allows the user to transfer assets and \textit{transactions} between the \textit{Base Chain} and the \textit{Dest Chain(s)}.
    \item \textit{Backend}: Infrastructure that simplifies the interaction between the Blockchains and the Mobile Application. Moreover, the Backend is the \textit{Relayer} that sends the transactions to the Blockchain networks.
    \item \textit{Mobile Application}: User interface that allows the user to interact with the Sapphire Wallet ecosystem.
\end{itemize}

A simplified architecture of the Sapphire Wallet Infrastructure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:problem_approach/infrastructure}. The specific components will be described in the following sections.
