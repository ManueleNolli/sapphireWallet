\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

The Sapphire Wallet system is composed of three four components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Blockchain}: Two or more blockchains networks of which one is called \textit{BaseChain} and the others are called \textit{DestChain(s)}. In the BaseChain the main smart contracts are deployed.
    \item \textit{Bridge}: The bridge that connects the \textit{BaseChain} to the \textit{DestChain(s)}.
    \item \textit{Backend}: The backend infrastructure that simplifies the interaction between the blockchain and the mobile application. Moreover, the backend is the \textit{Relayer} that sends the transactions to the blockchain network.
    \item \textit{Mobile Application}: The mobile application that interacts with the backend and the blockchain network.
\end{itemize}

A simplified architecture of the Sapphire Wallet Infrastructure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:problem_approach/infrastructure}. The specific components will be described in the following sections.
