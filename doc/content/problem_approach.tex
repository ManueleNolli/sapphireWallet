\chapter{Problem Approach: Sapphire Wallet}
\label{chap:problem_approach}

In this chapter, the approach to the problem is presented. The Sapphire Wallet is a Multi-Chain account abstraction, based on an improved version of \hyperref[subsec:argent]{Argent Wallet}.

The main goal of Sapphire Wallet is to give an idea of the potential of the blockchain technology in combination with Account Abstraction Layer and Multi-Chain Bridge approach. To achieve this goal, the Sapphire Wallet includes a set of features already present in the Argent Wallet, such as the Guardian, the Wallet Recovery, and the Wallet Creation. In addition, the Sapphire Wallet includes a Multi-Chain Bridge, which allows the user to interact with different blockchains. 

It is important to notice that the Sapphire Wallet is developed on the current version of EVM\footnote{Dencun version}. There are several promising \hyperref[subsec:eips]{EIPs} that could be implemented in the future, such as the \hyperref[subsubsec:eip-3074]{EIP-3074} and the \hyperref[subsubsec:erc-7702]{EIP-7702}, but they need a hard fork of the Ethereum network. Whatever the final Account abstraction Implementation is, the Sapphire Wallet provides a realistic Proof of Concept of the future of blockchain technology.
